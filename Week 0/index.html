  <h2 id="history"> History of Asmara</h2>
  <p>
    Although it would be easy to think of Asmara, the Eritrean capital, solely as an Italian built colonial city, its origins
    actually reach back some 700 years. Originally, it is said, there were four clans living in the Asmara area on the Kebessa
    Plateau:
    <em>the Gheza Gurtom, the Gheza Shelele, the Gheza Serenser and Gheza Asmae.</em> Encouraged by their women, the men united
    the four clans and defeated the bandits who preyed on the area. After the victory, a new name was given to the place,
    Arbaete Asmara which literally means, in the Tigrinya language,
    <strong>
      <em> "the four are united." </em>
    </strong>Eventually Arbaete was dropped and it has been called Asmara, though there is still a zone called Arbaete Asmara. Another
    legend tells that in this region the Queen of Sheba gave birth to the son of Solomon, Menelik I.

    Located at over 2,000 m above sea level, the capital of Eritrea developed from the 1890s onwards as a military outpost for
    the Italian colonial power. After 1935, Asmara underwent a large scale programme of construction applying the Italian
    rationalist idiom of the time to governmental edifices, residential and commercial buildings, churches, mosques, synagogues,
    cinemas, hotels, etc. The property encompasses the area of the city that resulted from various phases of planning between
    1893 and 1941, as well as the indigenous unplanned neighbourhoods of Arbate Asmera and Abbashawel. It is an exceptional
    example of early modernist urbanism at the beginning of the 20th century and its application in an African context.

  </p>
  <p>
    Asmara is possibly the safest African capital for travelers. It is one of the cleanest cities in Africa. The streets are
    elegantly lined with palms and a string of boutiques, coffee-shops and restaurants reminiscent of southern Italy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beautiful city has officially been labeled a World Heritage site by the United Nations Education, Social and Cultural
    Organization (UNESCO).

  <h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
  <p>
    The city lies at an elevation of 2,325 metres (7,628 feet) above sea level. It lies on north-south trending highlands known
    as the Eritrean Highlands, an extension of the Ethiopian Highlands. The temperate central portion, where Asmara lies,
    is situated on a rocky highland plateau, which separates the western lowlands from the eastern coastal plains. The lands
    that surround Asmara are very fertile, especially those to the south towards the Debub Region of Eritrea. The highlands
    that Asmara is located in fall away to reveal the eastern lowlands, characterized by the searing heat and humidity of
    the Eritrean salt pans, lapped by the Red Sea. To the west of the plateau stretches a vast semi-arid hilly terrain continuing
    all the way towards the border with Sudan through the Gash-Barka Region.

  <h2 id="religion"> Religion</h2>
  <p>

    Asmara's very diverse cultural heritage is obvious: three of the most prominent landmarks in the city are the Catholic Cathedral,
    the Al Khulafa Al Rashiudin Mosque and the Nda Mariam Coptic Cathedral.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a world characterized by religious conflict, Christians, Muslims and others have lived peacefully together in Asmara for
    centuries.
